# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game

My implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++ where the user plays against a simple AI. 

This program was mostly for me to practice using pointers and to get better at C++.

## Usage

This was implemented using [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) with Ubuntu 20.04 and `gcc` version 9.3.0.

```
g++ -o tic-tac-toe tic-tac-toe.cpp
./tic-tac-toe
```
